# Cloudflare Status Worker

This Worker is pretty simple, when there's an incident logged on
[Cloudflare's Status Page](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/)
the worker will send a new Discord message about it.
When there's an update to the incident, the message is updated!

I made this for my personal server so that when there's an incident I can
find out early and quickly. Saves me pulling my hair out for a while
and finally checking the status page later only to see a problem.

## How do I set this up?

That's simple! Just click the "Deploy with Workers" button below and then add
a new secret in the GitHub repo called `DISCORD_WEBHOOK`. Point this to your channels webhook and done!\
The Worker will now send new incidents and updates :)
